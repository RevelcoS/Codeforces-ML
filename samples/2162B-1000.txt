You are given a binary string s of length n.

Your task is to find any subsequence p of s such that:

The subsequence p
 is non-decreasing. That is, each character in p
 is not greater than the next one.
Let x
 denote the string obtained by removing all characters of p
 from s, while preserving the order of the remaining characters. Then x
 must be a palindrome.

You only need to output any valid subsequence p that satisfies both conditions. If no such subsequence exists, output −1.

Note that an empty string is both non-decreasing and a palindrome.
